Abstract

The extraction and sequencing of ancient DNA has provided scientist with time series to detect selection signatures, but a
comprehensive evaluation of the power gained is still lacking. It is only in the last decade that the improvement of
sequencing technologies and methodologies have allowed the retrieval of DNA from fossils. The incorporation of ancient
specimens with modern populations increases power to detect selection signatures. This study represents a thorough
investigation of the parameters expected to impact the identifiability of selection, providing guidelines for designing
future studies of ancient selection. Parameters such as the number of time series, sample size and population demography
were challenged.

Allele trajectories were generated with SLiM, but were shaped to resemble the Domestic horse population for the study of
selection during domestication. Selection was then inferred with sr and its accuracy and precision were evaluated. Only strong
selection signatures could be detected suggesting that such methodology is only possible on populations that have experienced
strong selection, such as domestic animals. The number of time series and sample size did not appear to play a critical role
in the detection of selection signals suggesting that this pipeline can be extended to other domesticates, even with a lesser
ancient DNA dataset. On the other hand, a reduction in population size reduced power to detect selection. It is therefore
critical to model the demography of the population of interest before aiming to study selection.
